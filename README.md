# Analyzing historical stock/revenue data TESLA and GAME STOP Comparison
Determining the value of a stock is a complex process, influenced by factors such as outstanding shares, anticipated future profits, and various other considerations. A pivotal element in this evaluation is the company's profit and its growth trajectory. If a company's profits are on the rise, it is expected that the stock price will follow suit, presenting an opportunity for potential gains. Conversely, if one anticipates a decline in a stock's value, there is a strategy called short selling to capitalize on such a scenario.

In short selling, an investor borrows shares, sells them, and later repurchases the same shares to return them to the lender. This strategy is often employed by experienced investors, including hedge funds. The premise is that stocks tend to fall faster than they rise, allowing for quicker profits. However, it comes with the risk of losses if the stock price rises instead.

An example of short selling gone awry is the case of Tesla. Several years ago, many short sellers targeted Tesla, expecting its stock to decline. However, Tesla's financial performance improved, and profits were on the upswing, leading to an increase in the stock price. This scenario defied the expectations of short sellers, emphasizing the importance of considering a company's fundamental performance.

Recent instances, such as the GameStop saga driven by individual investors on the Reddit community WallStreetBets, have showcased how unconventional factors can impact stock prices. GameStop, a struggling video game retailer, saw its shares surge due to increased demand initiated by individual investors. This unexpected rise resulted in substantial losses for hedge funds that had shorted the stock.

As a data scientist working for a hedge fund, my task is to extract profit data for both Tesla and GameStop and develop a dashboard. This dashboard aims to provide a comparative analysis of the stock prices and associated profits, offering insights into the dynamics between stock performance and hedge fund gains or losses.
